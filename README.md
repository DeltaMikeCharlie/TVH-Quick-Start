**Overview**

TVHeadEnd PVR Quick Start is a Kodi addon for use with LibreELEC.

This quick start addon is targeted at novice users with a single protocol (DVB-T, DVB-C, DVB-S, etc) in order to guide them through the setup of a simple PVR system.  More advanced configuration operations will need to be performed using TVHeadEnd’s normal built-in configuration wizard.

The addon is designed to automate the tasks of:
* Installing the LibreELEC TVHeadEnd server addon.
* Installing the Kodi HTS PVR Client addon.
* Accessing the TVHeadEnd server via a web browser and running its Wizard.

Once complete, the user should have a working PVR capable of:
* Viewing live TV
* Viewing associated OTA EPG information
* Recording shows and playing those recordings.
